# Technology :

**3. [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package** :

- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
- A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
- SQL is used by language programmers to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.

**2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** :

- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

- A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

- Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**3. [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3)** :

- Inquirer.js strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for Node.js.

- NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

**4. [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)** :

- Uses easy-table for printing to console.log

- Used to print MySQL rows to the console.

**5. [asciiart-logo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciiart-logo)** :

- asciiart-logo renders a splash screen in text console with logo from ASCII characters.

- Splash screen is a rectangular panel and logo is the application name rendered by ASCII-art fonts extended by optional additional information.

- asciiart-logo can be used by starting of command line tools, web servers or REST API microservices as a visual feedback to the user or administrator about successful start of the application.

- Used this NPM package to add some visual flare to the main logo.

# Usage :
